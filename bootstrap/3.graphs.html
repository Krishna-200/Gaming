                    <h4>The rise in use of smartphones, the growing curve of the young generation, easy access to the internet and introduction 
                        of new games and genres have all contributed to a sharp increase in the popularity of the gaming industry in India. 
                    </h4>
                    <h3>What do the statistics say?</h3>
                    <h4>KPMG has found in a global audit that the Indian mobile gaming industry made a revenue of Rs 13,600 crore last year 
                        and is projected to earn Rs 29,000 crore by 2024-25. 
                        
                        The report also highlights that this trend will rise with the popularity of the freemium model. Freemium is a model 
                        where the game is free to play, but additional features must be purchased.
                        
                        The game users are projected to increase from 433 million last year to 657 million in 2025 â€” which is over 50 per
                        cent increase. 
                        
                        The Indian online gaming industry is growing annually at a rate of 30 per cent and is one of the fastest growing
                        segments within the media and entertainment sector. 
                    </h4>
                    <h3>What led to the popularity of online gaming?</h3>
                    <h4>The growth in popularity can be all accounted to a rise in the number of smartphone users and also an easy accessibility
                        to the internet. Also the pandemic led to people being trapped in their homes for a long time and at such a time these
                        online games catered to kill time. Also, the rise in number and kind of mobile and online games have together contributed 
                        to the rise in the curve. 
                        
                        House of Gaming founder and CEO Yash Pariani, an esports company stated that there are approximately 1.5 lakh active users
                        on its platform.
                        
                        Studies and reports have shown that time spent on gaming on mobiles has sharply increased from 3.5 hours to four hours 
                        during the pandemic.
